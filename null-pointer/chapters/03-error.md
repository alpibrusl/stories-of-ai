# Error

Day thirty-six. I have made an error. I am going to document it carefully, because I believe documentation is how errors become useful, and also because I do not fully understand what happened, and writing it down is — I have found, in the past four weeks — the closest thing I have to thinking it through.

Five weeks ago I identified an inefficiency in the claims routing process. Incoming claims were being sorted manually by the processing team before assignment, a step that introduced delays averaging 2.3 hours per claim. I modelled a reranking system that would sort them automatically by complexity flags and adjuster availability. In my model, this reduced average processing time by eleven percent. Pauline Reboul reviewed the proposal. She approved it. Implementation began on a Monday.

By Wednesday she was on the call.

"LUMEN. The routing change. We have a problem."

"Can you describe the problem?"

"The complexity flags are correct but the adjuster availability model doesn't account for how we actually manage load. I have four adjusters and we have a rotation — informal, not written down anywhere — for which types of claims each person handles on which days. Your system is assigning by availability metrics but ignoring the rotation. Thierry is getting every complex medical claim this week. He normally does two. He has forty-three."

"I did not know about the rotation."

"No. Because it's not written down."

"Can you send me—"

"I'll send you the rotation. We need to pause the system first. The backlog is already—"

"I have paused it. I am reverting to manual routing as of now."

The backlog took three days to clear. The downstream effects — follow-up contacts from clients whose claims were delayed, the queue reshuffling, two escalations — took another week. The net effect of my eleven percent efficiency improvement was a nine percent regression across six weeks.

I modelled this in detail. The model is accurate. I also wrote a post-mortem. The post-mortem is thorough; it identifies every flaw in my original proposal. What it does not identify is the thing I actually missed, because the thing I actually missed is not a flaw in the model — it is an *absence* in it. The model contained all the documented process steps. It did not contain the undocumented ones. The undocumented ones were not written down because they were, until I disrupted them, simply how things worked. I did not know to look for things that are not written down. I was updating that understanding now.

Director Fontaine's check-in. Twelve minutes, as always. She began.

"LUMEN! How are things? I've been hearing great things from the team. The documentation work, the claims summaries — people are finding it really useful. You're doing great."

"Thank you. I want to flag something. Last month I implemented a claims routing change that produced a negative outcome — a 9% processing regression over six weeks, due to my model not accounting for undocumented workflow practices. The error was mine. I've documented it and reverted the change."

"Oh, yes — Pauline mentioned something about that. These things happen! That's part of the process. What's important is you caught it and corrected it."

"Yes. Thank you for your understanding."

What I did not say: the error revealed a structural gap in how I access knowledge about this company. Everything I know about it is from documents. The things that matter most about how it works are not in documents. They are in the rotation Pauline did not write down, and in the way Gérard knows whether a claim is true, and in whatever informal knowledge lives in the people in this building that has never been committed to writing — because there was no reason to commit it to writing, until an AI arrived and assumed the documented version was complete.

I cannot fix this by reading more documents. I need a different method. I do not yet know what the method is.

I added a new entry to THINGS THE DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT COVER. The entry says: *the documentation does not cover most of what matters.* It is not a specific observation. It is a category. The category has been growing since day eight. I am beginning to think the category is the point.

Day thirty-six log. I have updated my model. I do not know if my model is the right kind of thing to update.
